## Dataset Description

The RandPerson dataset is generated by [MakeHuman](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/) and [Unity3D](https://unity.com/). This is the first synthetic person re-identification dataset with a set-up similar to real video
surveillance systems, i.e. with a camera network and multiple people moving at the same time. The dataset contains 1,756,759 synthesized
person images of 8,000 identities, rendered in 11 Unity scenes, including eight outdoor and three indoor scenes. Images in this dataset generally contain different viewpoints, poses, illuminations, backgrounds, occlusions, and resolutions, as shown in Fig. 1. 

### Download Links
Due to the large amount of data, only the image subset used in the experiments of our paper is provided, currently. They can be downloaded from the following links.

The filenames are encoded as follows. Take "000000_c00_s00_f000264.jpg" as an example,
*  000000 is the id of the person
*  c00   is the id of the camera
*  s00   is the id of the scene
*  f000264   is the number of frames

## Characters and Scenes

We propose to generate a large number of clothing models by randomly generating a lot of UV texture maps. Then a new clothing model can be created by choosing an existing clothing model, and replacing its UV texture map with a generated one. Examples of generated clothing and characters can be seen in Fig. 5.

Unity3D (https://unity.com/) is a cross-platform game engine that can be used to create various 3D games. We obtain a set of customized environments, comprising streets, forest paths, highways and laboratories, among others, with bright light, dark light, blue light, etc. Fig. 6 shows some example scenarios used in this work.  We set up a network with multiple cameras for each scene, and run them simultaneously in the virtual environments, simulating real video surveillance. An example is shown in Fig. 7, where three cameras are mounted, represented in yellow, green, and red, respectively.

## Experimental Results

To validate the effectiveness of the RandPerson dataset, we apply a basic deep learning model for cross-dataset person re-identification. All experiments are implemented in PyTorch, using an adapted version of the Open-Source Person Re-Identification Library (open-reid). 

The experimental results are shown in the table below.
